  MAX_LOAD_ATTEMPTS: 60, // Maximum seconds to wait for game load
};
```

### Features Explained

#### Building Purchase Strategy

- Calculates cost-per-CPS ratio for each building
- Buys buildings when they are more efficient than available upgrades
- Takes into account current cookie production and prices

#### Upgrade Management

- Evaluates each upgrade's CPS improvement
- Compares upgrade efficiency with building efficiency
- Skips certain problematic upgrades automatically

#### Golden Cookie Handling

- Automatically clicks all golden cookies
- Collects reindeer during Christmas season
- Manages wrinklers for optimal cookie production

## Performance

The script is optimized for long-term running with:

- Efficient error handling
- Memory leak prevention
- Safe game state management
- Proper initialization checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Game not fully loaded" message**

   - Wait for the game to fully load before running the script
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **Script stops working**

   - Type `stopAutomation()` in the console
   - Refresh the page and rerun the script

3. **Performance issues**
   - Adjust `TICK_RATE` and `PURCHASE_INTERVAL` in the CONFIG object
   - Higher values = better performance but slower automation
